## Building
Pre-built versions of Flame Next will be available in the Releases section of the repository. These builds are generated using electron-builder on my laptop (yes this is developed on a laptop).

If you prefer to build Flame Next for your own system, you can do so using `electron-builder`, which is included in the `node_modules` directory. You will need node-js, and npm. Once installed, download the repository, extract the zip and go into the root (where index.html is) and open a terminal and type `npx electron-builder` then open the dist folder and install the file.

## Future Features
Information about future features and updates can be found on the Projects page.
